CGLogger
========

Needed a better way of logging data in production code. Now I am starting to get more in depth, why not have something I can disperse through all my projects more easily. Need to build this out in a much more clean way. To add these functions throughout app quicker I created a preprocessor define for CGLog and then find replace all NSLog with CGLog. Lots of work needed....
